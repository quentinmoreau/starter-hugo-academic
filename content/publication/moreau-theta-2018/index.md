abstract: Categorical clustering in the visual system is thought to have evolved as
  a function of intrinsic (intra-areal) and extrinsic (interareal) connectivity and
  experience. In the visual system, the extrastriate body area (EBA), an occipito-temporal
  region, responds to full body and body part images under the organizational principle
  of their functional/semantic meaning. Although frequency-specific modulations of
  neural activity associated with perceptive and cognitive functions are increasingly
  attracting the interest of neurophysiologists and cognitive neuroscientists, perceiving
  single body parts with different functional meaning and full body images induces
  time–frequency modulations over occipito-temporal electrodes are yet to be described.
  Here, we studied this issue by measuring EEG in participants who passively observed
  fingers, hands, arms and faceless full body images with four control plant stimuli,
  each bearing hierarchical analogy with the body stimuli. We confirmed that occipito-temporal
  electrodes (compatible with the location of EBA) show a larger event-related potential
  (ERP, N190) for body-related images. Furthermore, we identified a body part-specific
  (i.e. selective for hands and arms) theta event-related synchronization increase
  under the same electrodes. This frequency modulation associated with the perception
  of body effectors over occipito-temporal cortices is in line with recent findings
  of categorical organization of neural responses to human effectors in the visual
  system.
