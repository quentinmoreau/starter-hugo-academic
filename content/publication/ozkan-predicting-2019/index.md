abstract: The ability to anticipate and detect changes in human movement helps people
  to modify their behaviors in ever changing environments. Studies indicate that expertise
  modulates observation of domain-specific actions in sports—a process that is crucial
  for adapting rapidly to a new situation, often before awareness of environmental
  changes is achieved. Here, we explored the electrophysiological underpinnings of
  wheelchair basketball players predicting the fate of free throws performed by wheelchair
  basketball athletes. We performed electroencephalography (EEG) in semi-professional
  wheelchair players with different degrees of expertise (players) and in ambulant,
  non-expert people (controls) while they observed movie stimuli of a free throw that
  could land inside or outside the basket. On each trial, participants were asked
  to predict the outcome of the throw. For each group, event-related potentials (ERPs)
  were averaged as a function of condition, using only the trials that were correctly
  predicted. Results show that compared to controls, expert players exhibit a greater
  negative amplitude of oCNV over Pz (an observational contingent negative variation-like
  waveform which is considered a marker of action effect prediction) during the wrist
  movement preceding the ball release (the last 100 ms of the shot), which carries
  the most crucial kinematic information regarding the fate of the throw. Our data
  provide further support to the view that functional modulation of the action observation
  network is associated with expertise.
