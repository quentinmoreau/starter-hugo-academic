abstract: How does the brain allow us to interact with others? Social neuroscience
  has already provided some answers to these questions but has tended to treat high-level,
  cognitive interpretations of social behavior separately from the sensorimotor mechanisms
  upon which they rely. The goal here is to identify the underlying neural processes
  and mechanisms linking sensorimotor coordination and intention attribution. We combine
  the human dynamic clamp, a novel paradigm for studyingrealistic social behavior,
  with high-resolution electroencephalography. The collection of humanness and intention
  attribution reports, kinematics, and neural data affords an opportunity to relate
  brain activity to the ongoing social behavior. Behavioral results demonstrate that
  sensorimotor coordination influences the judgments of cooperativeness and humanness.
  Analysis of brain dynamics reveals two distinct networks related to the integration
  of visuo-motor information from self and other which overlap over the right parietal
  region. Furthermore, judgment of humanness and cooperation of others modulate the
  functional connectivity between this right parietal hub and the prefrontal cortex.
  These results reveal how distributed neural dynamics integrates information from
  “low-level” sensorimotor mechanisms and “high-level” social cognition to support
  the realistic social behaviors that play out in real time during interactive scenarios.
