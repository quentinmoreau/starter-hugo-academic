abstract: Discrepancies between sensory predictions and action outcome are at the
  base of error coding. However, these phenomena have mainly been studied focussing
  on individual performance. Here, we explored EEG responses to motor prediction errors
  during a human-avatar interaction and show that Theta/Alpha activity of the frontal
  error-monitoring system works in phase with activity of the occipito-temporal node
  of the action observation network. Our motor interaction paradigm required healthy
  individuals to synchronize their reach-to-grasp movements with those of a virtual
  partner in conditions that did (Interactive) or did not require (Cued) movement
  prediction and adaptation to the partner's actions. Crucially, in 30% of the trials
  the virtual partner suddenly and unpredictably changed its movement trajectory thereby
  violating the human participant's expectation. These changes elicited error-related
  neuromarkers (ERN/Pe - Theta/Alpha modulations) over fronto-central electrodes during
  the Interactive condition. Source localization and connectivity analyses showed
  that the frontal Theta/Alpha activity induced by violations of the expected interactive
  movements was in phase with occipito-temporal Theta/Alpha activity. These results
  expand current knowledge about the neural correlates of on-line interpersonal motor
  interactions linking the frontal error-monitoring system to visual, body motion-related,
  responses.
