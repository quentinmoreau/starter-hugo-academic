abstract: Synchronous interpersonal motor interactions require moment-to-moment prediction
  and proactive monitoring of the partner's actions. Neurophysiologically, this is
  highlighted by an enhancement of midfrontal theta (4–7 Hz) oscillations. In this
  study, we explored the causal role of midfrontal theta for interpersonal motor interactions
  using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). We implemented a realistic
  human–avatar interaction task in immersive virtual reality where participants controlled
  a virtual arm and hand to press a button synchronously with a virtual partner. Participants
  completed the task while receiving EEG-informed theta (Experiment 1) or beta (control
  frequency, Experiment 2) tACS over the frontal midline, as well as sham stimulation
  as a control. Results showed that midfrontal theta tACS significantly improved behavioral
  performance (i.e., reduced interpersonal asynchrony) and participants' motor strategies
  (i.e., increased movement times and reduced RTs), whereas beta tACS had no effect
  on these measures. These results suggest that theta tACS over frontal areas facilitates
  action monitoring and motor abilities supporting interpersonal interactions.
