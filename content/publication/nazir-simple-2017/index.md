abstract: Research in cognitive neuroscience has shown that brain structures serving
  perceptual, emotional, and motor processes are also recruited during the understanding
  of language when it refers to emotion, perception, and action. However, the exact
  linguistic and extralinguistic conditions under which such language-induced activity
  in modality-specific cortex is triggered are not yet well understood. The purpose
  of this study is to introduce a simple experimental technique that allows for the
  online measure of language-induced activity in motor structures of the brain. This
  technique consists in the use of a grip force sensor that captures subtle grip force
  variations while participants listen to words and sentences. Since grip force reflects
  activity in motor brain structures, the continuous monitoring of force fluctuations
  provides a fine-grained estimation of motor activity across time. In other terms,
  this method allows for both localization of the source of language-induced activity
  to motor brain structures and high temporal resolution of the recorded data. To
  facilitate comparison of the data to be collected with this tool, we present two
  experiments that describe in detail the technical setup, the nature of the recorded
  data, and the analyses (including justification about the data filtering and artifact
  rejection) that we applied. We also discuss how the tool could be used in other
  domains of behavioral research.
